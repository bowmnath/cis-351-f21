## Course Description

Introduction to the logical structure of computers,
including combinational and sequential logic, arithmetic, data paths,
CPU control, caches, and basic pipelining.
Introduction to assembly language including data movement, arithmetic,
comparing and branching, bit manipulation, procedure calling, memory access,
and implementation of high-level language constructs.

The best way to contact me about the course is through
[Piazza](http://www.piazza.com/gvsu/fall2021/cis351section3/home).
I also regularly monitor the channel for this course on the unofficial
GVSU Discord,
though I will not post official announcements there and you are not responsible
for monitoring it.

I am also happy to schedule additional meetings outside of office hours.

## Course Meetings

The course meets three times per week for lecture:
* 9 - 9:50 AM Monday, Wednesday, Friday (MAK-B-1118)

There is a lab once per week:
* 1 - 2:50 PM Thursdays (MAK-A-1105)

## Sickness Policies

If you are sick,
please do not come to class, lab, or office hours.
Just let me know,
and we will figure out a way for you to make up any missed work.
Previous lecture videos are linked to from the course homepage.
While these are not in general a substitute for coming to class,
they can be a good replacement in an instance where you are feeling unwell.

## Course Objectives

After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Create simple combinatorial and sequential circuits.
* Predict the execution of an instruction in a simple CPU.
* Compare a pipelined CPU design with a single-cycle CPU design.
* Explain the benefits of the memory hierarchy.
* Predict how a cache configuration determines whether a memory
  access is a hit or a miss.
* Produce code in an assembly language using standard programming constructs.

## Course Policies

* All assignments must be submitted to Prairielearn and are due at 11:59 PM EST
  on the due date.
  Some assignments will require drawing diagrams that must be uploaded to
  Prairielearn.
  If you do not have convenient access to a scanner,
  there are free document scanning apps available,
  such as the Google Drive app.
  I reserve the right to specify alternate submission cutoffs per assignment.
* No late assignments will be accepted.
  In cases of extreme emergency, such as an accident or illness resulting in
  hospitalization, please contact me and I will be reasonable.
* Homework assignments are to be completed individually unless directed otherwise.
  You may discuss the assignments with other students,
  but every student is expected to submit his or her own work.
  If you find yourself emailing code or written solutions to another student,
  even "for reference", you are violating this policy.
* Labs and projects are to be completed in pairs.
* Exams will not be rescheduled unless in extreme emergencies.
  If you have a question about this, please ask me.
  The exception to this is if an exam falls during a religious observence that
  would not allow you to participate in the exam.
  Rescheduling is perfectly fine in this case,
  but please let me know *as soon as possible* if this will be an issue.
* This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at
  http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/.

## Academic Honesty

## Inclusion and Equity

As an instructor,
I will strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment in our
class.
To that end,
please reach out to me if there is anything in my behavior or in the classroom
environment that makes you feel unwelcome or unvalued.
I will seek to keep any information you share with me in this regard
