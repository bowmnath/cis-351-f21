These are activity questions used in a previous edition of the course.
They are open-ended, they were meant to foster discussion,
and students received a lot of help from me when answering them.
Also, some of them are even trick questions.
So, don't stress too much about getting exactly the correct answer if you look
through these,
and feel free to ask me about anything.

I've left them here because they make a good study guide for the exams.
They give you some idea of the topics I need you to know and the types of
questions I can ask,
although the exam questions will be less open-ended or ambiguous.
This course will also have its own activities,
and you will likely see many of the questions reused.
