In your groups, answer the following questions.
No need to report the answers to me --
this is just for practice.
We may not get through all of the questions every week.
You may want to take notes during the discussion,
because these questions will be helpful in reviewing for exams.

I will be dropping in and out of rooms to facilitate to the discussions and in
case you have any questions.
Think of it like me walking around the classroom and listening to different
groups.
Again, this isn't meant to be for a grade,
so don't be concerned about giving a wrong answer even if I am in the room.
You can also flag me down in Zoom if you have a question even if I'm not in the
room
(I think the button in Zoom looks like a question mark).

Note: some questions are taken entirely or in part from your textbook.

# General Questions

1. What is a *conflict* in the context of caches?
   Can it occur if the cache is not full?
   Why or why not?

2. Associative caches generally reduce the number of conflicts that occur
   *even when they do not change the overall amount of information stored*.
   Can you think of an intuitive reason why?

3. LRU (least-recently used) is an example of a replacement policy that could
   be used in an associative cache.
   Why does it not make sense to have a replacement policy for a direct-mapped
   cache?
   (It may be helpful to consider how you would describe in your own words what
   a replacement policy does -- it's purpose.)

4. What big-picture idea that we have discussed in the context of caches would
   tell us that LRU is a good idea for a replacement policy?
   (Hint: what properties of data accesses make caches a good idea in the first
   place?)

5. Which of the following would be most useful in exploiting spatial locality
   of data accesses?
   * increasing cache size
   * increasing block size
   * increasing associativity

6. Work through the questions in the
   [caches and associativity handout](/misc/associative-cache-handout.pdf)

7. Work through the questions in the
   [caches and block size handout](/misc/block-cache-handout.pdf)
